Of course. This is an excellent idea to consolidate our progress. Here is a comprehensive prompt designed to bring a new AI instance completely up to speed on the TagKosha project.

### **Project Brief: TagKosha - Android Personal Notes App**

**1. Project Vision & Core Concept:**
TagKosha is a personal notes application for Android (with a future web app planned) built on Firebase. Its core differentiator is a powerful, hierarchical tagging system designed for sophisticated organization and discovery. The project's philosophy is "Smart Structure," where the system understands the relationships between tags to provide a superior user experience.

**2. Core Requirements & Features (Phase 1 - Current State):**

*   **Platform:** Android (Java/Kotlin) with a Firebase backend.
*   **Database:** Cloud Firestore.
*   **Authentication:** Firebase Authentication (Email/Password).
*   **Data Model:**
    *   `users/{userId}`: Stores user profile info.
    *   `notes/{noteId}`: Stores note content, timestamps, and a `tags` array (e.g., `["#work/projectA", "#urgent"]`).
    *   `tags/{tagId}`: Stores unique tag names for efficient querying.
*   **CRUD Operations:** Users can create, read, update, and delete notes. Deletion is available both within the note editor and via a long-press context menu on the main list.
*   **Tagging Grammar (The "Smart Structure"):**
    *   **Tag Identifier:** `#`
    *   **Hierarchy Separator:** `/` (The only character for nesting).
    *   **Allowed Characters:** Letters, numbers, `_`, `-`.
    *   **Separators/Forbidden:** All other characters (whitespace, commas, periods, etc.) act as tag separators.
*   **Filtering & Search:**
    *   The app features a sophisticated, multi-select "faceted search" system, not a simple search bar.
    *   Users filter notes by selecting tags from a "Tag Explorer" panel.
    *   The system supports "AND" filtering (selecting `#work` and `#urgent` shows notes with both).
    *   **Hierarchical Search:** The search logic is implemented **client-side**. Selecting a parent tag (e.g., `#work`) correctly finds and filters for notes containing that tag and all its children (e.g., `#work/projectA`).

**3. Current Architecture & State of Implementation:**

*   **Architecture Pattern:** The app uses Android Architecture Components, specifically `ViewModel` and `LiveData`, to manage data in a lifecycle-aware and efficient manner.
*   **Data Management:**
    *   A `TagsViewModel` acts as the "single source of truth" for the user's entire tag list. It uses a Firestore `addSnapshotListener` to maintain a real-time, in-memory cache of all tags, which is observed by the UI. This is highly efficient and minimizes Firebase read costs.
    *   The `MainActivity` manages the query and listener for the `notes` collection, as this data is specific to the view and its active filters.
*   **User Interface (UI):**
    *   **Main Screen (`MainActivity`):** Displays a `RecyclerView` of note cards. At the top, an "Active Filters" panel shows selected tags as dismissible chips.
    *   **Tag Explorer (`TagExplorerBottomSheet`):** A bottom sheet panel for tag selection.
        *   **Browse Mode:** When the search bar is empty, it displays an expandable/collapsible **Tree View** of the tag hierarchy, sorted alphabetically. Display names are clean (e.g., `kitchen` instead of `#work/kitchen`).
        *   **Search Mode:** When the user types, the view switches to a **flat list** of all matching tags. Display names are the full, unambiguous path (e.g., `#work/kitchen`) for context.
    *   **Note List Tags:** Tags on the main note cards are implemented as clickable, styled `TextView`s within a `FlexboxLayout`. They are styled to look like clean, minimalist text links.

**4. Key Learning Points & Design Decisions Made:**

*   **Chip vs. TextView for Tags:** We initially tried to use Material `Chip` components for tags. After significant difficulty fighting against the component's default styling (padding, borders, minimum size), we concluded that for a minimalist, text-like appearance, using styled `TextView`s was the simpler, more direct, and more reliable solution. `FlexboxLayout` was chosen over `ChipGroup` to achieve precise left-alignment.
*   **Client-Side vs. Server-Side Logic:**
    *   **Hierarchical Search:** We debated implementing hierarchical search via a server-side query vs. a client-side filter. We chose the **client-side approach** because the `TagsViewModel` already maintains a complete cache of all tags. Filtering this small, in-memory list is instantaneous and has zero additional Firebase cost, making it the superior solution for this specific use case.
    *   **Tag Usage Count (Future Feature):** We concluded that calculating and maintaining a `count` for each tag **must be done server-side** using a **Cloud Function**. A client-side approach for this is architecturally unsound, as it is vulnerable to race conditions, offline inconsistencies, and incomplete operations, which would lead to data corruption.

**5. Plan Forward (Next Steps):**

The next feature to be implemented is **"Tag Popularity (Usage Count & Sorting)"**.

*   **Backend Task:**
    1.  Add a `count: number` field to the documents in the `tags` collection.
    2.  Write, test, and deploy a Firebase **Cloud Function** that triggers on writes to the `notes` collection.
    3.  This function must intelligently parse the `before` and `after` states of the `tags` array to correctly increment/decrement the counts for all affected tags and their parents up the hierarchy.
*   **Frontend Task:**
    1.  Update the `TagNode` data model to include the `count`.
    2.  Update the `TagsViewModel` to fetch the `count` and sort the tags by this value.
    3.  Update the `TagTreeAdapter` to display the count next to the tag name (e.g., `#work (12)`).
